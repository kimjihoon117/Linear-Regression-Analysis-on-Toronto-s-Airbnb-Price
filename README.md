# Linear-Regression-Analysis-on-Toronto-s-Airbnb-Price
Complete Multiple Linear Regression and Model Validation 

In what way do specific predictors contribute to the overall price of Airbnb listings in Canadian Dollars? For our predictors, we will be observing the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, cleanliness rating (out of 5.0), whether or not the listing is shared (if yes, takes on value one, if not, takes on value zero) and whether or not the host has been rated superhost (if yes, takes on value one multiplied by the number of bedrooms, if no takes on value zero). It is important to note, that through this regression, we will not be accounting for any geo-spatial data, such as proximity to a city center.
